# The ruleset

As mentioned before, SiMoN has a lexicon and a rule compound. While the lexicon contains all the necessary patterns and CCls to generate inflectional paradigms, the ruleset determines how *multichar symbols* are treated and additionally takes care of accounting for particular morpho-phonetic phenomena in the generation process of surface forms.

## The *two-level* principle

In the previous chapter 
The ruleset of SiMon is divided into specific parts, just as the lexicon.
They are described in the sections 5.1.1 - 5.x

## The ruleset sections

### Alphabet

The alphabet section contains a list of letters valid for the used language. In case of Sicilian this includes the letters *a* - *z* plus accented vowels like *à*, *â*, *è*, *é* and so on.
All available *multichar symbols* are contained in the alphabet as well. They are listed as two layer pairs that determine `0` as emission for each of them:

```+V_ARI:0  +V_IRI:0 +V_FIN:0 +V_NOFIN:0 +V_PP:0```

The line above filters any annotated verb and eliminates the symbols `V_ARI`, `V_IRI`, etc. from the final surface form of any verb.

### Sets

The (mathematical) sets defined for SiMoN are bags of letters, one containing all vowels (`Vowel`) the other containing all consonants (`Cons`) of the alphabet. These sets are used in the [context rules](#context-rules) and simplify accessing single letters by their type.

### Definitions

The definitons in the ruleset could be described as categories for the *multichar symbols*
